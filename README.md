# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



1. Header / Navbar
Bootstrap Navbar: Use a dark-themed Bootstrap Navbar with links to various sections like Home, TV Shows, Movies, Recently Added, and My List. The logo can be placed on the left, and the right side of the navbar can have a search bar, notifications icon, and user profile icon.

2. Slidebar
A search movie sidebar can be a functional feature on a Netflix-like platform to help users filter or search for movies and TV shows based on various criteria such as title, genre, release year, or rating. The sidebar would slide in from the left (or right) and provide users with interactive search and filter options.
